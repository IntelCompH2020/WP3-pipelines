# WP3-KPI-calculator

This tool, developed by the UC3M, generates JSON files that contain calculated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These KPIs are formatted to be compatible with the STI Viewer application, ensuring seamless uploads and integration.

The tool is implemented in notebook `KPI_calculation.ipynb` that should be executed in a Spark cluster. You should update the paths to the data files in the relevant cells.

**Important:** A copy of the OpenAIRE Research Graph should be available for the script execution.
